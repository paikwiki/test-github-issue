# Test

This doc was made for the test. I made a new project and then applied a remote 
repository which was using for another project. This remote repo already has 
source codes. I wonder if I can commit this repo from new working directory.

## result

```
git push -u origin master
To https://github.com/paikwiki/test-github-issue.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
 error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/paikwiki/test-github-issue.git'
 hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
 hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
 hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
 hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
 hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
